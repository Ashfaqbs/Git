# Using of git commit (without m flag )

To add a detailed commit message with an explanation of the changes our making to our Spring Boot project. Here's how we can complete the commit message in the interactive editor that Git opens when we run `git commit` without the `-m` flag.

### Steps to Add Detailed Commit Message:

1. **Git Opens the Commit Editor**: When we run `git commit` without `-m`, Git opens the default text editor (Vim ) to allow we to write a more detailed commit message.

2. **Understanding the Commit Editor Layout**:
   - The lines starting with `#` are comments and will be ignored by Git when we commit.
   - The lines without `#` are where we should write our commit message like last of the default description #, ~ add enter and add the comments.
   - we will also see a list of changes to be committed (new files, modified files, etc.).

3. **Structure of Commit Message**:
   It's good practice to follow the format below for our commit message:
   - **Header**: A short summary of what the commit does (max 50 characters).
   - **Body**: A more detailed explanation of what changes were made and why (optional, but recommended for complex changes).
   - **Footer**: If applicable, mention any related issues or tasks (e.g., Jira ticket number).

   In our case, we can write the commit message like this:

   ```
   Add Kafka integration for Spring Boot application

   - Added necessary Kafka configuration (KafkaConfig.java) for the application
   - Created KafkaProducerService to send messages to Kafka topics
   - Created KafkaListener to consume messages from Kafka topics
   - Updated application.properties for Kafka settings
   - Added test cases for Kafka integration (KafkaPartitionsSb3ApplicationTests.java)

   This commit sets up the basic Kafka producer-consumer integration in the Spring Boot application.
   ```

4. **Editing in Vim (if using Vim)**:
   - Once our in the editor, scroll down to the area where we can add our commit message (below the `#` comments).
   - Delete any placeholder text if necessary and write our message as described above.
   - To **exit and save** the commit message in Vim, follow these steps:
     1. Press `Esc` to make sure we are not in edit mode.
     2. Type `:wq` (stands for "write and quit").
     3. Press `Enter`.

   **If we are using a different editor** (like Nano or VSCode), the process might be different:
   - In **Nano**: After writing our message, press `Ctrl+O` to save and `Ctrl+X` to exit.
   - In **VSCode**: After writing our commit message, we can simply save and close the editor.

5. **Push our Changes**:
   After you've saved the commit message and exited the editor, Git will apply the commit. To push the commit to the remote repository, run:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   (If we are working on a branch other than `main`, replace `main` with the appropriate branch name).

### In Summary:
- **Step 1**: Run `git commit` to open the commit message editor.
- **Step 2**: Write a detailed message explaining what was changed and why (structure it with a header, body, and footer).
- **Step 3**: Save and exit the editor (`:wq` in Vim).
- **Step 4**: Push the commit to the remote repository using `git push`.

### Example Commit Message:
```
Set up Kafka integration in Spring Boot project

- Added Kafka producer service for message sending
- Configured Kafka consumer for topic subscriptions
- Updated `application.properties` with Kafka connection settings
- Added integration test for Kafka functionality

This commit establishes the basic Kafka producer-consumer setup and testing in the Spring Boot application.
```

This will give we a good structure for our commit message. It's always a good idea to explain the **"why"** behind our changes, especially for important features like Kafka integration.
